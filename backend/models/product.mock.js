        description: `Crafted from a ribbed Japanese yarn that hugs the torso and has a slight flare through the knee,
        the York might just be the most comfortable skirt of all time. More things to love about it: It’s soft,
        travel-friendly, and quick-drying. The skirt’s foldover waistband offers comfort and polish, and looks especially
        sharp when paired with the matching Avery top.`,
